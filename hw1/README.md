1. -Show that for any positive real constants a, b, and d, (an + b)d = Î˜(nd).
- Is 34n = O(24n)? Is 34n = 2O(4n)
1. Exercise 3.2-4 and 3.2-5. Bounds on Functions.
1. Problem 3-4 a, b, g, h . Big-O and other notation.
1. Place the following functions by order of growth, from smallest to largest. For each adjacent pair in the list, give a proof that the earlier one is assymptotically smaller than (or equal to ) the second, by giving a big-O proof.
- n2
- n2 - n/ lg n
- n1.01
- 2n
- 3n/2
- 4lg lg n
- lg3 n
- 4lg n

- (lg n)lg n / lg lg n
1. Exercise 4.4-3. 4.4-8. and Problem 4-3. b, c, h, j. For each recurrence, provide an upper bound. If the recurrence cannot be solved by the master method, you must justify the solution via a substitution proof or by drawing a recursion tree.
