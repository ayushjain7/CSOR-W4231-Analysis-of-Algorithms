    1. Show that for any positive real constants a, b, and d, (an + b)d = Θ(nd).
    1. Is 34n = O(24n)? Is 34n = 2O(4n)
1. Exercise 3.2-4 and 3.2-5. Bounds on Functions.
1. Problem 3-4 a, b, g, h . Big-O and other notation.
1. Place the following functions by order of growth, from smallest to largest. For each adjacent pair in the list, give a proof that the earlier one is assymptotically smaller than (or equal to ) the second, by giving a big-O proof.

  - n2 - n/ lg n
  - n1.01
  - 2n
  - 3n/2
  - 4lg lg n
  - lg3 n
  - 4lg n
